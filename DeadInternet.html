<p>This theory states that the internet consists of little very little real human activity or entirely bot activity, and automatically generated content. With massive developments in Artifical intelligence in recent years the theory has gained many supporters. The origins of the theory are hard to track down, however like other internet theories it rumored to have emerged from 4chan from either the late 2010s or even early 2020s. The main concerns of the theory is that with bots generating so much fake content, fake responses, rage bait, replies, and even entire people is that it'd a lot easier for companies or governments to control populations, through fake media, and distractions away from larger issues.</p>
<p>Many consider the advancement of AI and automated generation of content to be evidence of the theory. Many websites such as Reddit, and Twitter are suspected to harbor potentially thousands or more bots that automatically like posts that make no sense or reply to posts with comments that make no sense such as "I hate texting" which would then be followed by different activites, such as "I hate texting i just want to hold ur hand" these posts would recieve thousands of likes, which many use as evidence for the Dead Internet Theory. Many users of Twitter also note that bot activity has affected their experiences negatively.</p>
