<h2>Doveland, Wisconsin</h2>
<p>Doveland, Wisconsin was supposedly a small town that disappeared in the 1990s. Some people in Wisconsin alledgy posses shirts,mugs, and souvenirs from the towns with people going as far as to say they remember the town or had family who lived there.When searching the town on Google there existed a 'Ghost trace' of Doveland with recommended search options that brought up no results. Similarities between Doveland is also seen other supposed small towns across the United States, such as Urkhammer Iowa which was said to have disappeared without a trace in 1928, and Langville, Montana.</p>
<p>Possible explanations for the disappearence have been theorized to be as following</p>
<li>Nothing more than a hoax, or internet legend</li>
<li>Unicorporated settlement that was destroyed by damming, which would be similar to a town that suffered the same fate known as Werner</li>
<li>Project Sanguine builds</li>
<li>Military science experiment gone wrong</li>
<li>The town quite possibly just vanished</li>
<li>The town never existed to begin with</li>
<li>The town never existed but due to internet fascination with the small town became real and then disappeared as an effect</li>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the mystery surrounding Langville Monatana most likley comes from the remake of Ghostbusters in 2016.</p>
