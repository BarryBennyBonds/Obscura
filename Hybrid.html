    Hybrid RPG
</h2>
<p>Hyrbid RPG 
 is an unfinished table top role playing game (ttrpg). The rules are expansive and seemingly nonsensical and contridict one another, with the writer of the rules often going on rants injecting their own opionions which in some cases just seems to be the ramblings of an incel. In addition to long winded ramblings many pop culture references are present as well. The creator of the rule set and game has stated that since the rules seem to be so complicated that a wide release of the game would most likely never happen and the game is essentially destined to always be somewhat niche. Information about the game and it's rules are somewhat infamous online, but in depth explanations are either not available, or not popular.</p><br />
<p>Some people believe that there is a method to the madness presented by the creator and state that a deeper meaning is present, such as theories stating the rules of Hybrid are the rules of the simulation humanity lives in</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, this isn't the only 'weird' table top role playing game (ttrpg). FATAL (Fantasy, Adventure to Adult Lechery or From Another Time Antoher Land) Which was first published in 2002 by Fatal Games contains many rules, but it perhas is more well known for the extreme indepth character creation, mental illnesses characters could role, graphic sexual content, higher level mathematics, and aabsurd mechanics such as a skill that is dedicated to defining the amount of urine a character can produce, and at what speed it is produced. </p>
<p>The creator of Hybrid RPG has their very own website but the last update we know of was posted on June 23rd 2022 with mentions of several dimesions, as well as several hundred links which the creator states "WATCH AND LISTEN TO + LEARN FROM VIDEOS, AND ALSO NOT EVERYTHING is TRUE, IS WHY TO "FIGURE OUT" TRUTHs: USE BASIC LOGIC = COMMON SENSE = WHY HUNDRED LINKS R GIVEN TO FIGURE OUT TRUTHs. AND, FOR NEXT STEP GET RID OF PROPERTY TAX & iNHERITANCE TAX & REPLACE CRONY CAPITIALISM WITH MANDATORY UBI:".</p><br />
