<h2>Cicada 3301</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Cicada 3301 is a nickname given to three sets of puzzles which were posted under the name of "3301" online between 2012 and 2014. The first puzzle started on Janurary 2nd, 2012, on 4chan and ran for nearly a month. The second round of puzles began one year later on Janurary 4th, 2013, and then a third puzzle was posted to Twitter on the 4th of January 2014. No new puzzles were published after the third puzzle, and it should be noted that the third puzzle remains unsolved to this day.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The puzzles focus heavily on data security, cryptography, steganography, internet anonymity, original music, bootable Linux CD's, digital images, physical paper signs, unpublished cryptic books written in runes, with the same OpenPGP private key to confirm the authenticity of each puzzle and clue.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose stated for such elaborate puzzles was to recruit "highly intelligent individuals", however many people believe there is more to it. Some theories claim that Cicada 3301 is a secret society with the goal of improving cryptography, privacy, anonymity, or that the puzzles were created by a cult or religion seeking to recruit new memebers who have cryptography and computer security skills. Many have speculated that the puzzles are a recruitment toolfor the NSA,CIA, MI6, or a cyber mercenary group. Others however believe that Cicada 3301 is an alternate reality game (ARG), although no company or individual has attempted to monetize it. Other explanations state the Cicada 3301 is a remnant of the late 1980s and 1990s cypherpunk movement.</p>

<h3>Resolution of the first puzzle</h3>
<p>The first puzzle was solved by Marcus Wanner in 2013. According the Mark, those who solved the puzzles were asked questions about their support of information freedom, online privacy, online freedom, and rejection of censorship. Those who answered the questions in ways that were satisfactory were invited to a private forum, where they were instructed to devise and complete a project intended to further the ideals of the group. Mark did not finish his work on a method of general decryption and the website was eventually removed.</p>

<h3>Allegations against the group</h3>
<p>Authorities from the Los Andes Province of Chile claimed that Cicada 3301 is a "hacker group" and engaged in illegal activities. Cicada 3301 responded to the claim by issuing a OpenPGP signed that denied any involvement in illegal activity.</p>
    <p>In july of 2015, a group calling themselves "3301" hacked into Planned Parenthood's database, however the group appeared to have to association with the puzzle makers. Cicada 3301 later issued a PGP signed statement which stated that they "are not associated with this group in any way" and also stated that the group did not "condone their use of our name, number, or symbolism". The hacker group later confirmed that they were not affiliated with Cicada 3301.
