<p>Numerology (Also known as Arithmanyc) is a belief that numbers have a divine, occult, or even mystical purpose. Numerology appears to have been used by many old world cultures and is still used by some today in things such as astrology. Because of the belief that numbers have some sacred purpose it is theorized by some that numbers tie into the simulation theory, or could be utilized in a way to create a 'anti life equation'. Fanscination with numbers has been seen through out history such as the belief system of Pythagoreanism which holds the ideas that everything in the universe is made from numbers and as a result can be counted, and that every mystery can be solved through numbers. Thera are several numbers with importance within Pythagoreanism such as, the number one being related to intelligence, the number two being related to though, 4 which when broken down equals 2 * 2 or 2 + 2 meaning it is perfectly even and is related to justice, and the number three which is believed to hold true understanding because the number contains a beginning, a middle, and end, with 3 characteristics being associated with the number with those characteristics being, prudence, drive, and good fortune.</p>

<h3>Sacred geometry and Pythagoreanism expanded</h3> 
<p>Pythagorean philosophers believed there was a close link between shapes and numbers, which was later proved through simple geometrical theorms such as "the sum of the angles of a triangle equals two right angles". Shapes such pentagons symbolised health, while the pentagram was also viewed with reverance because as each diagonal divides the two others at the golden ratio.</p>

<h3>Music and Harmony</h3>
<p>Pythagoras pioneered the mathematical and experimental study of music by objectively measuring physicl quanitinites, such as the length of strings and discovered mathematical relationships of music through arithmetic ratios. Pythagoras is also credited with discovering that the most harmonious musical intervals are created by the simple numerical ratio of the first four natural numbers that derive from the relations of string length, the octave (1/2), the fifth (2/3), and the fourth (3/4). The sum of those numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 and was seen as the perfect number by Pythagoreans, because it contained 'The whole essenial nature of numbers". Pythagorean philosophers held the belief that different types of music could stimulate their souls, and certain stirring songs could have notes that existed in the same ratio as the "distances of the heavenly bodies from the centre of Earth".</p>

<h3>Cosmology</h3>
<p>The early Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus was one of the most prominent figures in Pythagoreanism, and was the precursor of Copernicus, who believed in the idea that the Earth is not the center of the universe and is a planet instead. Philolaus believed that limited and unlimited were the very components of the cosmos and had always existed, another belief held by Philoaus is that the center of the universe was the number 1. Philolaus also called the number one an "even-odd" number because of it's ability to generate both even and odd numbers.</p>
