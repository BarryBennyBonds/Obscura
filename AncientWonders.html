<h2>The 7 wonders of the ancient world and their possible ties to ancient aliens</h2>

<h4>Great Pyramids Of Giza</h4>
<p>You are probably familar with the Great pyramids of Giza so this explanation will be breif. It is believed to have taken 20 years to construct with 100000 workers who were skilled stoneworkers. The structure was meant to serve as a tomb for the 4th dynasty Pharaoh Khufu. The outermost stones of the structure was highly polished limestone but after such a long time the pyramid was stripped of the valulables it contained and was repurposed.</p>
<p>The pyramids being created by ancient aliens in a theory that is proposed by those that believe that a structure of this magnitude being created by ancient humans is impossible, this is due to near perfect measurements, and almost perfect alignment with the 4 cardinal points on the compass, and dimensions of the pyramid convert to a ratio that equals 2π with near perfect accuracy.</p>

<h4>The hanging gardens of Babylon</h4>
<p>The gardens were supposedly built in 600BC and were theorized to have been destroyed by the erosion of a empires, invading armies, or an earthquake in 226 BC. The mystery of these gardens is that it is questionable if the gardens ever existed at all. It is generally believed to have been constructed by King Nebuchadrezzar II for his wife because she missed the greenery of her home. Descripitons of the garden suggest the gardens were an elaborate series of rooftop gardens or the gardens were built into the walls. Excavations suggest there was a use of heavy irrigation to water the gardens.</p>
<p>Propents of the ancient alien theory use the gardens as evidence that humanity has had contact with advanced aliens and these aliens stayed on Earth for extended periods of time.</p>

<h4>Temple Of Artemis</h4>
<p>The temple was built in 550BC and destroyed by arson in 356BC by a man named Herostratus who seeked fame by any means neccessary, another interesting thing is that is believed that the arson took place on the same night Alexander the Great was born.</p>
<p>Unlike most temples during this time, the temple of Artemis was built from arble, glittered with gold,more than one hundred columns that supported the roof which was also at least double the size of the pantheon. The temple also housed the statue of the goddess Artemis,although the original no longer exists.</p>

<h4>Statue of Zeus At Olympia</h4>
<p>The Statue of Zeus was a seated figure about 12.4 meters(41ft) tall made to honor the God Zeus. The statue was made of gold panels and ivory plates on a wooden framework, created around 435 BC and lost and destroyed by the end of the 6th century as there are many conflicting accounts of when it was destroyed and how it was destroyed.</p>
<p>The Roman Emperor Caligua gave orders that statues of the gods were famous for their sanctity and should have their heads removed and replaced by his, however Caligua was assassinated (41 AD)before this could happen, interestingly enough it is said his death was fortold by the statue when it reportedly laughed so loud that scaffolding collapsed and the workmen ran away. The 11th century Byzantine historian Georgios Kedrenos recorded a tradition which stated that the statue was taken to Constantinople, where it was destroyed in the great fire of the Palace of Lausus, in 475 AD. Another theory states that the statue was heavily damaged by a fire in 425 AD but damage before then is also implied by Lucian Of Samosata in the 2nd century stating "they have laid hands on your person at Olympia, my lord High-Thunderer, and you had not the energy to wake the dogs or call in the neighbours; surely they might have come to the rescue and caught the fellows before they had finished packing up the loot."</p>

<h4>Mausoleum At Halincarnassus</h4>
<p>The mausoleum was constructed in 352 BC and was destroyed by an earthquake in 1404 AD. The mausoleum was built as a tomb for Mausolus, who was a governor in the Persian Empire(His name is also now the eponym for all mausoleums). Mausolus's widowed wife Artemisia (who was also his sister, however this was considered customary at the time) commissioned well known Greek artchitects to design the tomb. The mausoleum was nearly 14 stories tall and square, with the base being more than 10000 square feet. At each side of the tomb stood nine massive columns, and at the top was a stepped pyramid which stood by a four horse marble chariot where there were images of Mausolus and Artemisia. </p>
<p>Modern historians believe that two years would not be enough time to build a structure of that size and complexity leading many to believe that construction began before the death of Mausolus or was continued by later rulers.</p>
<p>The structure is believed to have been destroyed an earthquake around 1402, however it should be noted that at the time, local Greeks, and Turks had no name, or legends about the ruins, which possibly suggests an even earlier destruction.</p>

<h4>The Colossus Of Rhodes</h4>
<p>The colossus itself was a statue of the Greek sun god Helios, constructed in the city of Rhodes (on the island of the same name) in 280 BC. The statue was constructed to celebrate the succesful defence of Rhodes against an attack by Demetrius I of Macedon, who had besieged the city for a year with a large army and navy. Most contemporary descriptions of the Colossus place it's height to be approximately 70 cubits (33 meters or 108 feet), which places the ancient statue to be near the height of the Modern Statue of Liberty (from feet to crown, not including base).</p>
<p>However the statue did not stand for long as it was destroyed by an earthquake in 226 BC, with the statue snapping at the knees and the remains being broken up and sold for scrap in 654 AD after Arabian forces raided Rhodes and transported the bronze to the east to be melted down. </p>

<h4>The Lighthouse of Alexandria</h4>
<p>The lighthouse was constructed by the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Ancient Egypt during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (280-247 BC). The lighthouse was estimated to be at least 100 meters of 330 feet tall and for many centuries was one of the tallest man-made structures in the world.</p>
<p>Between the years 956 AD - 1323 AD the lighthouse was severely damaged by 3 earhquakes and became abandoned, however much of the structure remained somewhat in tact until 1480 AD, when the last remnants of the structure were used to build the Citadel of Qaitbay on the same site.</p>

<h3>Possible connections</h3>
<p>Many believers of the ancient aliens theory believe that ancient humans did not have the technology to create these advanced structures, and that they were directly or indirectly helped by extraterestial beings. </p>
