<h2>Fresno Nightcrawler</h2>
<p>The Fresno Nightcrawler is a supposed cryptid that gained it's name from the first sighting in Fresno California, however it should be noted that other sightings have been reported such as in Yosemite national park, Poland, and Montana.The nightcrawlers appear to be a pair of white pants that walk around, and are rumored to be many things with theories ranging from, extraterestrials, pants or puppets on wires,  or a new species with really short arms The nightcrawlers are relatively short in height standing at approximately 1.5 meters, with most of their height coming from there legs. Due to the poor quality of the camera footage it is unknown if the nightcrawlers have details on their small upper bodies. Attempts to recreate the movement demonstrated by the nightcrawlers have been unsuccessful, the nightcrawler has also been featured on the Syfy show Fact or Faked:Paranormal Files, with the team demeaning the nightcrawler to be unexplainable.</p>
<p>The nightcrawler is considered a type of 'fun and harmless' crytpid, due to the fact that sightings and recordings of the supposed creature show it doing nothing more than walking a little funny, another noteworthy thing about the nightcrawlers is that they don't seem to be camera shy like most other crytpids</p>

<li>2. Don't hurt the internets favorite pair of pants</li>
