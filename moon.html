<h2>The Hollow Moon, and Spaceship Moon theory</h2>
<p>Both of these theries are considered to be pseudoscientific hypotheses that claim that Earth's Moon is either entirely hollow or somewhat hollow with a large spatial interior area. It should be noted that no scientific evidence exists to support this theory, as seismic observations, and other data shows that the Moon has a thin crust, thick mante, and a small core less dense than the core of Earth. The Hollow Moon theory usually ties back into theories about ancient aliens with some even linking it to ideas stating that humans are not native to Earth and were sent to inhabit Earth as a punishment, evidence for this theory is the importance of the stars in old world cultures, human anatomy not alligning to Earth standards such as lower back pain which may suggest that humans are not meant to walk upright, and since childbirth is so painful and can lead to death as well.</p>
<p>Many theories have been proposed about the origins of the Moon, such as George Darwin (Son of Charles Darwin) in 1879 proposed the idea that the Moon originated when a rapidly spinning Earth expelled a piece of mass. However the modern theory of the origins of the Moon argue that a Mars sized body commonly called Theia, struck the Earth 4.5 billion years ago with the debris forming a ring around the Earth that eventually condensed into the Moon, and is the favored hypothesis for the origins of the Moon.</p>
